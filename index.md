**Battery Health Charging is a Gnome Extension that provides a graphical user interface to a Gnome environment for setting charging limit (charging threshold) of a laptop.**
<br>
<br>
When users keep their laptop connected to AC adapter all the time, the battery is often in a state of high-power (98-100%) for an extended length of time which causes a reduction in battery life. To prevent reduction of battery life, the laptop manufacturers provides as option to limit the charging of a battery to level that prolongs battery life (charging threshold). Battery Health Charging extension provides a Graphical user interface, to set these charging limit / threshold.

This extension allows you to set 2 or 3 preset (depending on laptop) modes of threshold:
* **Full Capacity Mode:** Battery is charged to its full capacity for longer use on battery power (charger unplugged).

* **Balanced Mode:** Stops charging when battery level is around 80%. This mode is recommended when using the laptop on battery power during meetings or conferences.

* **Maximum Lifespan Mode:** Stops charging when battery level is  around  60%. This mode is recommended when the laptop is always powered by AC adapter.

The battery level at which the charger stops (charging threshold) may be at different on some laptop model.
