Now it will report only the current mode. conservation mode enabled displays max lifespan mode. conservation mode disable display full capacity mode.

When charging limit is enabled (battery_life_extender), Some models sets threshold to 60% and some models set threhsold to 80%, and the kernel doesnt report what is the current threshold value is, but only informs that charging limit is enabled or disabled. Now it will report only the current mode. battery_life_extender mode enabled, displays max lifespan mode. battery_life_extender mode disable, display full capacity mode.
